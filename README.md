## Phenomena 1

    - Discovered a large spike in members born in 1969
        - Many of these members also do not have a gender

    - Further research required - but hypotheses for this include - "I got my first real six-string", "bought it at the the five-and-dime", "It was the Summer of 69" or possibly trolling on behalf of citibike users.

    - Members of this 1969 demographic have above average trip durations
        - This is significant because while Birth Year is manually entered - trip durations are collected automatically.

## Phenomena 2

    - Discovered more age trolling
        - Assumed that the oldest people using citibike are 90 years old (a very conservative assumption in my opinion) and grouped all users older than that (or aged 69 and gender 0) as trolls and did further analysis
    - Further researched needed but one hypothesis that seems promising (due to the     greater distribution of trolls around central park is that people visiting New    York and biking through central park are a large portion of the trolls.
